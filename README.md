# Level The Playing Field

School Funding in Wales

### Running

In RStudio, run _batch.R_ to generate all the reports in the _docs_ directory. These are hosted on the main website at
http://leveltheplayingfield.wales.

There are custom analyses in the _posts_ directory for generating reports for the blog posts. These are written to the
_docs/posts_ directory.

There are experiments and _ad hoc_ analyses in _adhoc.R_. These do not create output for the website.
